2. The needy students who cannot afford such costly products and get them at low cost.
3. The products can also be utilized and the space also gets free occupied by that product in a room.
4. There will be a history option so that the transaction for the product can be seen by the new student and can directly visit to that student who have that product.
5. By this the communication between the students will also get developed.

The need of this application can be clearly seen in the survey results. The needs are given below:
1. The products after once not come in use and occupy a huge space in the rooms.
2. The new comers who know this thing doesnâ€™t wants to buy that product need to buy because they rarely communicate with seniors to ask for second hand products.
3. The students who cannot afford such products needs to buy for a single course.

### Features and scope of the

2. The students can upload more then one product but one product at a time.
